### Extra themes
 
 
### These are the extra themes that were once in Lilidog but have since been removed.

There are currently five dark GTK and matching Openbox themes.

Conanolis - The Anolis theme with contrasted highlights. <-- Personal favorite for work.
Earth - A theme with zero color throughout.
Drow - Similar to earth, but with a approx. hue 180 in text color for system match.
Neon - Dark pink/blue loud theme.  Just fun to have.
Cobalt - A Dark Blue Loud theme. Same.

### Instructions:
Download and unzip the 'extra-themes' folder. then, either make a folder for user use
named ~/.themes and place the themes into that folder, or put the themes directly into 
/usr/share/themes for systemwide use. Either way, the themes will then appear in your 
system settings appearance dialog. 

For those not using Lilidog, All of my GTK, Openbox, and matching Geany and xfce4-terminal themes 
can be found here: https://github.com/sleekmason/Themes

For those who are using Lilidog, All of the geany and xfce4-terminal themes are already present 
in the build. No need to download again.

### Note for Lilidog users: 
feel free to also edit /usr/local/bin/ld-themes and add any new theme names you like to the list.  
Those themes will then appear in the auto themes dialog and exhibit the same functionality.
