### Extra themes

### These are the themes currently in Lilidog.

### Instructions:
If using Lilidog, look in the installers under graphics to install 
these themes direcly to ~/.themes.

If using another distro, download and unzip the 'extra-themes-master' 
folder. Then, either make a folder in ~/.themes, and place the 
themes there, or put the themes directly into /usr/share/themes 
for systemwide use. 

Either way, the themes will then appear in your system settings 
appearance dialog. 

place the themes directly into /usr/share/themes for systemwide (root) use.

### To Remove:
Just remove the theme folders you one longer wish to use.  the 
~/.themes folder can be deleted as well.

### Note to those not using Lilidog:
All of my GTK, Openbox, and matching Geany and xfce4-terminal themes 
can be found here: https://github.com/sleekmason/Themes

### Note to those who are using Lilidog:
All of the geany and xfce4-terminal themes are already present in the 
build. No need to download again.

feel free to also edit /usr/local/bin/ld-themes and add any new theme 
names you like to the list. Those themes will then appear in the auto 
themes dialog and exhibit the same functionality.
