### Extra themes
 
 
# These are the extra themes that were once in Lilidog but have since been removed.

There are currently five dark GTK and matching Openbox themes.

Conanolis - The Anolis theme with contrasted highlights. <-- Personal favorite for work.
Earth - A theme with zero color throughout.
Drow - Similar to earth, but with a approx. hue 180 in text color for system match.
Neon - Dark pink/blue loud theme.  Just fun to have.
Cobalt - A Dark Blue Loud theme. Same.

There are matching Geany and xfce4-terminal themes here: https://github.com/sleekmason/Themes
If you are running Lilidog, those themes already exist in the build.  
No need to download those again.

# Instructions:
Download and unzip the resultant 'extra-themes' folder. then, either make a folder for user use:
named ~/.themes and place the themes into that folder, or put the themes directly into 
/usr/share/themes for systemwide use. Either way, the themes will then appear in your 
system settings appearance dialog. 

# For Lilidog users: 
feel free to also edit /usr/local/bin/ld-themes and add any new theme names you like to the list.  
Those themes will then appear in the auto themes dialog and exhibit the same functionality.
